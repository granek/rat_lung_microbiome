```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
file.path()
```

# Preparation
1. Run `preliminary_analyisis.R` first to generate `antibiotic_ps.rds`. (Might want to split that out into a separate file that can be run here.
)
2. Run antibiotic_run_lefse.sh to generate figures




# LefSE

```{r}
list.files("workspace/lefse/antibiotic_bool_biomarkers_raw_images/")
```

```{r}
library(knitr)
for (cur_pdf in Sys.glob("workspace/lefse/*.pdf")){
  include_graphics(cur_pdf)
}
```

```{r myfile-1-plot, echo = F, results = 'asis'}
for (cur_pdf in Sys.glob("workspace/lefse/*.pdf")){
  cat(paste0("![This is ", cur_pdf,"](", cur_pdf, ")\n"), fill=TRUE)
}
```

```{r myfile-1-plot, echo = F, results = 'asis'}
```

```{r}
list.files("workspace/lefse", pattern = ".pdf$",recursive = TRUE)
```

```{r}
list.files("workspace/lefse", pattern = ".png$",recursive = TRUE)
```

```{r myfile-2-plot, echo = F, results = 'asis'}
lefse_dir="workspace/lefse"
for (cur_png in list.files(lefse_dir, pattern = ".png$",recursive = TRUE,full.names = TRUE)){
  cat(paste0("![This is ", cur_png,"](", cur_png, ")\n"), fill=TRUE)
}
```



list.files(pattern = "_input.txt$", recursive = TRUE)



file.path("pr")

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
