# Preparation
1. Run `preliminary_analyisis.R` first to generate `antibiotic_ps.rds`. (Might want to split that out into a separate file that can be run here.
)
2. Run `antibiotic_run_lefse.sh` which:
    1. runs `antibiotic_for_lefse.R` to reformat data in lefse format
    2. runs lefse and generates figures

## Load Libraries
```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("phyloseq"))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("ggplot2"))
```

## Load Antibiotic Data
```{r}
antibiotic.rds = "workspace/antibiotic_ps.rds"
antibiotic.ps = readRDS(antibiotic.rds)

```

# Alpha Diversity Plots
```{r}
alpha_plot = plot_richness(antibiotic.ps, x = "antibiotic", 
                           measures = c("Chao1", "ACE", "Shannon", "InvSimpson"), nrow=NULL) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  theme(panel.background = element_blank(), 
        axis.text.x  = element_text(angle=0,hjust=0.5))
# ggsave(file=file.path(figure_dir,"max_rep_alpha_diversity.pdf"))
print(alpha_plot)
```

# Relative Abundance Plot

```{r}
antibiotic.ps.rel  = transform_sample_counts(antibiotic.ps, function(x) x / sum(x) )
antibiotic.ps.rel.filt = filter_taxa(antibiotic.ps.rel, function(x) var(x) > 1e-3, TRUE)

antibiotic.rel.plot = ggplot(psmelt(subset_samples(antibiotic.ps.rel.filt,lung=="left")), 
           aes_string(x = "animal", y = "Abundance", fill = "Genus")) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "stack") +
  facet_grid(~antibiotic) + 
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = -90, hjust = 0)) +
  theme(legend.key.size = unit(0.5, "cm"))
  # guides(fill=guide_legend(ncol=2))
print(antibiotic.rel.plot)
```

# Ordination Plots

## Ordination Plot Prep

### Pruning Rare Taxa
```{r}
min_counts = 2
sample_proportion = 0.01
min_samples = ceiling(sample_proportion*nsamples(antibiotic.ps))
wh0 = genefilter_sample(antibiotic.ps, 
                        filterfun_sample(function(x) x >= min_counts), 
                        A=min_samples)

antibiotic.pruned.ps = prune_taxa(wh0, antibiotic.ps)
ntaxa(antibiotic.ps)
ntaxa(antibiotic.pruned.ps)
```

The data was pruned before ordination to remove rare taxa. To be included in the pruned dataset, a taxon must occur at least `r min_counts` times in at least `r sample_proportion*100`% of samples (`r min_samples` samples). Before pruning there are `r ntaxa(antibiotic.ps)` taxa (all non-bacterial taxa have already been removed). After pruning there are `r ntaxa(antibiotic.pruned.ps)` taxa remaining.


## NMDS Plots
The goal of NMDS plots is to visualize relationships betwen datapoints. In the NMDS plots below, each point represents a sample. The distance between two points indicates how similar the two samples are in terms of bacterial community composition.

### NMDS Plot by Antibiotic
In this plot, points are colored by antibiotic treatment.

[comment]: # (This actually is the most platform independent comment)

[//]: # (We can see that coordinate 1 (along the x-axis) does a reasonably good job of distinguishing aspirated lungs from unaspirated lungs, indicating that aspiration has a large effect on the bacterial community. However, differences in antibiotic treatment does not seem to have a large effect.)

```{r}
## Check if any rows are all zero, because transform_sample_counts will generate NaNs from these
## which (apply(otu_table(antibiotic.pruned.ps), 1, function(row) all(row ==0 )))
## Transform to even sampling depth.
antibiotic.even.ps = transform_sample_counts(antibiotic.pruned.ps, function(x) 1E6 * x/sum(x))

## Remove samples with NaN (samples with all zero rows generate NaN when transformed above because of division by zero)
antibiotic.even.ps = prune_samples(complete.cases(otu_table(antibiotic.even.ps)),antibiotic.even.ps)

set.seed(1)
antibiotic.even.nmds <- ordinate(antibiotic.even.ps, "NMDS", "bray")
antibiotic.even.nmds.plot = plot_ordination(antibiotic.even.ps, antibiotic.even.nmds, type="samples")
ggplot(antibiotic.even.nmds.plot$data, aes(NMDS1, NMDS2)) +
  theme_classic() +
  geom_point(data = transform(antibiotic.even.nmds.plot$data, aspiration_bool = NULL, lung = NULL), 
             color = "grey90") +
  geom_point(aes(color = antibiotic))
```

- **Converged:** `r antibiotic.even.nmds$converged`

# LefSE
## With and Without Antibiotic
If we compare the "no antibiotic" treatment to all "antibiotic" treatments combined (still accounting for mode of administration), we see that two genera of Enterobacteriaceae distinguish them.

![Effect of antibiotic](workspace/lefse/antibiotic_bool.png)

*Serratia* is present in most of the "no-antibiotic" samples, but is not observed in any of the antibiotic treated samples.

![This is workspace/lefse/antibiotic_bool_biomarkers_raw_images/1_Bacteria-Proteobacteria-Gammaproteobacteria-Enterobacteriales-Enterobacteriaceae-Serratia.png](workspace/lefse/antibiotic_bool_biomarkers_raw_images/1_Bacteria-Proteobacteria-Gammaproteobacteria-Enterobacteriales-Enterobacteriaceae-Serratia.png)

*Pantoea* shows the opposite pattern: not observed in most "no-antibiotic" samples, and present in almost all samples form antibiotic treated animals

## Antibiotic Subclass Analysis
We can break out the individual modes of antibiotic administration to look for differences.  We find a weaker signal that seems to indicate there may be subtle differences.

### Subcutaneous enrichment
Some **subcutaneous** samples are enriched in *Caulobacter*, with some enrichment in **IV**.

### IV enrichment

A few of the **IV** administered animals have a small enrichment of *Rhodobacteraceae*, although the small number of samples and degree of enrichment make this suspect.
